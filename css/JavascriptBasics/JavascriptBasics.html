					<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						Javascript is a cross-platform object oriented scripting language. Javascipt is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript loves inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

								<a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>
								Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a alue. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span>var x;</span>
								</p>
						 	</li>

									Variable Assignment</a>
									Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
									<span> var x =10;</span>
								</a>
							</li>

								<a href="#">Data Types
								</a>
								<p>
									Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or false; null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number <span>- 42 </span> or 3.13159; String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks";</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 1, 'Dojo'] </span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane, last_name:'Doe'} </span>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#">Conditionals</a>
								<p align="left">
								When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of co
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#">Loops</a>
								<p align="left">Loops
								There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine if you have t run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
							</li>
							<li>
								<p align="left">
								<a href="#">Function</a>
								Functions are an ecapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get strated, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the tabe the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
